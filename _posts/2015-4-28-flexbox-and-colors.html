<p>Looking at an article recently on CodePen inspired a bit of curiosity. I saw the color declaration "deepskyblue" and I thought man that's a nice blue.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, there are several other color names available. A bit of research revealed approximately <strong>140!</strong>. I say approximately because who knows, the interwebs may be wrong and there may be more. But I found it on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp" target="_blank">w3schools.</a></p>
<p>Pretty cool to say the least.</p>
<p>This inspired me to create a personal guide. I've needed an excuse to use flexbox&hellip; well here it is:</p>
<p>
    <a class="btn btn--external" href="http://asilvadesigns.github.io/tools__colors/" target="blank">View Site</a>
</p>
<p>One last thing, if you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/asilvadesigns/tools__colors" target="blank">source code</a>, you'll notice no SASS partials. This is because of a faulty clone on my part where I overrode my local repo with an empty remote folder. Nice.</p>
<p>As a result I lost all my work minus what was open in Firefox and Chrome. Thank God for the console. I restored what I had and decided I'd leave it as it. I'll remake the source files if needed in the near future.</p>
