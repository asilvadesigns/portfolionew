<p>I've recently made the decision to go VIM &hellip; or at least try. The first time I've heard it mentioned was on <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2014/06/vim-for-people-who-think-things-like-vim-are-weird-and-hard/">CSS Wizardry.</a> Being a fan of Harry Robert's recent talks I decided to <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php">download it</a> and see what the hype is about.</p>
<p>Upon first opening it up I immediately felt the same way I did about SASS, overwhelmed and horrified that this might require use of the command line, which sure enough, it did.</p>
<p>The next several days should be interesting, but as I want to continue growing as an artist, for some strange reason, this just feels right. I'll continue to document my experience via this blog.</p>
