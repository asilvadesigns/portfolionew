<p>I won't lie I've struggled a bit with simply the installation, thus the headaches. A couple of tutorials I found online were very useful, the following proved invaluable.</p>
<ul class="indent list--bulleted">
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.vim.org/ugrankar.pdf">Installing Vim for Windows</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITZleEWYoU8">Vim for Windows Youtube Videos</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">VIM Adventures Games(Awesome)</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The headaches came in when I began to read the GitHub repositories that contained plug-ins I wanted, the most basic of which is a different colorscheme. All repositories mentioned Pathogen and Bundle, as well as Git(which I didn't know was separate from GitHub).</p>
<p>So I began my search and downloaded the appropriate files, all found on <a href="http://www.vim.org">www.vim.org.</a> A couple of installs, corrupted files, un-installs and successful re-installs later, I now finally have VIM working. Soon I'll post a thorough step-by-step install.</p>
